/**
 AXStreamer class can be used to stream from an external source as opposed to AXRecorder which is bound to the device's cameras. It has an internal state that can be controlled using start/stop methods. When the streamer is started it can receive the stream feed through calls to the methods

 It uses a push model and the caller of this methods is responsible for regulating the speed of the feed to realtime, otherwise the buffers might fill and packets will be dropped. It currently accepts raw PCM for audio and raw uncompressed frames for video. Recommanded formats are platform specific YpCbCr8 or RGB.
