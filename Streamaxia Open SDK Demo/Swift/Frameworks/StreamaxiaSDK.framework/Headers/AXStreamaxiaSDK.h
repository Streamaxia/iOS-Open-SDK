/**
 The Streamer SDK. It is the main object for the StreamaxiaSDK and wraps up the initialization and configuration
 of the SDK.
 
 In order to use the Streamer SDK, grab the AXStreamaxiaSDK singleton instance, and then setup the SDK using one 
 of the provided setup methods (default configuration or configuration from a custom URL).
 Make sure that the .config and .key files are either added in the main bundle, or are present as a custom bundle.
 If the latter, then the custom bundle's URL should be used as the custom URL.
 
 The status of the SDK can pe checked using -debugPrintSDKStatus, in order to investigate faulty initizations.
 It also provides info about the expiration date of the licence, the features and the list of valid bundle IDs
 that can be used with the current configuration, if any.
 
 *** SDK Features ***
 The SDK may provide certain features and can be checked if they are available using the -getAvailableFeatures
 method. If a feature is not available, calling the subsequent related APIs will have no effect and will also
 generate some warnings in the console.
 
 *** Trial Versions and Limited time licences ***
 The SDK may be a trial version or it may have a limited time licence. You may check if the licence has expired
 by using the -hasExpired property.
 
 *** Bundle ID lock ***
 The SDK may be configured to work only for certain bundle IDs. You may check if the current bundle ID is valid
 to be used with the SDK by using the -hasValidBundleID property.
